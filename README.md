# Rob the Anxious Robot

Rob is a robot that turns around randomly until he finds someone and then raises his "shoulders" like a bird puffs up it's feathers.

## Getting Started

I haven't figured exactly the best way to save a project like this to git so all of the files are in the same directory.
- If you are unfamiliar with the NXT-G language, I recommend [The Art of LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT-G Programming](https://epdf.tips/the-art-of-lego-mindstorms-nxt-g-programming.html) by Terry Griffin

### Lego Digital Designer File
The `.lxf` file is the file for [Lego Digital Designer](https://www.lego.com/en-us/ldd) and can be used as building instructions.

### NXT Code
- the `.rbt` file is the entry point for Rob's code
- the `constants.dat` and `settings.ini` are global to all projects
	- you may need to figure out how to merge the `constants.dat` with your existing `constants.dat`
- the `My Blocks` folder contains blocks that Rob relies on
